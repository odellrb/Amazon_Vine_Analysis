# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
This project analyzes the Amazon Vine program and determines if there is a bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members.
The analysis uses Google colab with PySpark and Jupyter notebook with pandas to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, load the transformed data into pgAdmin and calculate different metrics.
We focused on the US reviews for pet products.
